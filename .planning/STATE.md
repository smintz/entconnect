# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-08)

**Core value:** API-visible fields and their validation are defined exactly once — in the protobuf contract — and enforced identically at the transport boundary and at the storage layer, so contract/schema drift is a build failure rather than a runtime surprise.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — MixinForProto Core

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (MixinForProto Core)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-08-08 — Roadmap created from 62 v1 requirements across 5 phases

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Annotation contract (ANNO-*) ships in Phase 1 alongside mixin field derivation — closures do not survive entc's schema-load JSON boundary, so provenance must be written as annotations from the start
- Roadmap: FieldMask-gated Update (CRUD-04/05) ships in the same phase as Update RPC codegen (Phase 2) — the proto3 zero-collapse pitfall bites exactly there
- Roadmap: Flow binding (Phase 4) sequenced after CRUD and validation phases since it depends on the external, not-yet-built entflow project
- Roadmap: Full drift check (Phase 5) is a pure function of Phases 1-4 outputs, sequenced last

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 (Flow Binding) is gated on entflow having real, running sync-flow code — not just a design doc. Do not plan past interface sketching until that exists.
- Annotation struct versioning/forward-compatibility strategy (ANNO-04) needs concrete design during Phase 1 planning — no direct precedent.
- Sensitive-field marking (`field.Sensitive()` inference) is an unresolved open question with security implications, deferred to v2 (MIX2-02) but worth a decision checkpoint by end of Phase 1.
